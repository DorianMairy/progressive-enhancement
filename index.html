        <h3>The story</h3>
          <p class="un">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <br>
            <q class="green"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q><br>
            The farmer said,<br><br><q class="red"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q><br>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, 
            and in the evening everybody came back and said,<br><br><q class="green">“Oh, isn’t that lucky.</q><br>
            What a great turn of events. 
            You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,<br><br><q class="red"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p></q><br>

            
            <p class="deux">Following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
            he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said,<br><br> <q class="green">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</q><br> <br> and the farmer responded,<br><br><q class="red"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q><br>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <br> <br> <q class="green">“Isn’t that great!”</q> <br><br> Again, he said,<br><br><q class="red"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p></q>
            
            <p class="trois">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
         <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective.<br>
